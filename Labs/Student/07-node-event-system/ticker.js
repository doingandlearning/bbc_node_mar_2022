// Part 1
// Ticker: Write a function that accepts a number and a callback as the
// arguments. The function will return an EventEmitter that emits an event
// called "tick" every 50 milliseconds until the number of milliseconds is passed
// from the invocation of the function. The function will also call the callback
// when the number of milliseconds has passed, providing, as the result, the
// total count of tick events emitted. Hint: you can use setTimeout() to
// schedule another setTimeout() recursively or you could use setInterval().

const EventEmitter = require("events");

function tickingTimer(ms, cb) {
  const ee = new EventEmitter();
  let time = 0;

  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    time += 50;
    if (time > ms) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      cb();
      return;
    }
    ee.emit("tick", time);
  }, 50);

  return ee;
}

tickingTimer(199, () => console.log("all done!")).on("tick", (time) =>
  console.log("tick", time)
);

// Part 2
// A simple modification:
// Modify the function created in exercise 3.2 so that it emits a tick event
// immediately after the function is invoked.

// Part 3:
// Playing with errors:
// Modify the function created in exercise 3.3 so that it produces an error if
// the timestamp at the moment of a tick (including the initial one that we
// added as part of exercise 3.3) is divisible by 5. Propagate the error using
// both the callback and the event emitter. Hint: use Date.now() to get the
// timestamp and the remainder (%) operator to check whether the timestamp is
// divisible by 5.
